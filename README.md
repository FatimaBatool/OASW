# OASW

Optimum average silhouette width clustering methods (OASW) 


Wellcome! this repository is based on the algorithms that implement the OASW clustering methodology. These methods are developed for the
hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering domains. The repository contains implementation of four algorithms, namely, HOSil (hierarchical Optimum average SILhouette width clustering), OSIL (the non-hierarchical version), FOSIL(fast OSil version), and PAMSIL (an OASW strategy based on medoids proposed elsewhere).


The methodologies were developed in the following preprints:


An agglomerative hierarchical clustering method by optimizing the average silhouette width [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.12356.pdf)
