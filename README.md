# OASW
Optimum average silhouette width clustering methods
Wellcome! this repository is based on the algorithms that implements the OASW clustering methodology. These methods are developed for the
hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering domains. The repository contains in total 4 full algorithms, namely, HOSil (hierarchical Optimum average SILhouette width clustering), OSIL (the non-hierarchical version), and FOSIL(fast OSil version), and PAMSIL (an OASW strategy based on medoids).
